### 题目1 把皇后问题 --已经解决

### 题目 2   Subset Sum --正在解决



  Let’s consider a more complicated problem, called SubsetSum: 

Given a set X of positive integers and target integer T, is there a subset of elements in X that
add up to T? 



Notice that there can be more than one such subset. For example,

if X = {8, 6,7, 5, 3, 10, 9} and T = 15, the answer is True,

 because the subsets {8, 7} and {7, 5, 3} and {6, 9} and {5, 10} all sum to 15.



 On the other hand, if
X = {11, 6, 5,1, 7,13, 12} and T = 15, the answer is False
